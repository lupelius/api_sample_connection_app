Required parameters:

Authentication:
    A shared secret is used to authenticate the request. Each request needs to be 
    signed and timestamped.

    Please note, the time used in the request and the time on our servers should be
    close. The action 'time' can be used to check the epoch time on our servers.
    Epoch in seconds.
    
    In order to sign the request, you need to hash the string resulting after concatenating
    the epoch time and the shared secret, the hashing algorithm used: sha256.
    For example:
  
    ReporoApiKey = 'ThisIsMyKey';
    SharedSecret = 'ThisIsASecret';
    ReqEpoch = TIME(); //Epoch time in seconds
    Signature = SHA256(ReqEpoch + SharedSecret);
    
    Request.addHeader('x-reporo-epoch', ReqEpoch);
    Request.addHeader('x-reporo-key', ReporoApiKey);
    Request.addHeader('x-reporo-mash', Signature);

    The shared secret should never be sent as part of the request.
    The 'time' action is provided to test authentication.
